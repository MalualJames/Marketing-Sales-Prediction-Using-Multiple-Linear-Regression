# Marketing Sales Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how advertising budgets on YouTube, Facebook, and Newspaper influence product sales. 
The goal is to build a predictive multiple linear regression model and provide actionable insights for marketing strategy.

## Dataset
Dataset sourced from the `datarium` R package for educational demonstration purposes.
Variables:
- **youtube**: Advertising budget on YouTube
- **facebook**: Advertising budget on Facebook
- **newspaper**: Advertising budget on Newspaper
- **sales**: Product sales (response variable)

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Correlation analysis
3. Multiple linear regression modeling
4. Model diagnostics: residual plots, normality, multicollinearity (VIF)
5. Model evaluation using R² and predictions
6. Visualization of relationships and predictions

## Key Results
- R² ≈ 0.90 → Model explains 90% of variance in sales.
- Facebook and YouTube advertising significantly impact sales.
- Newspaper advertising is not statistically significant.
- The model predicts sales accurately and can guide marketing budget allocation.

## Visualizations
![Sales vs YouTube]
![Predicted vs Actual]

## Business Recommendations
- Increase budget allocation toward Facebook and YouTube campaigns.
- Reduce or optimize spending on Newspaper advertising.
- Use the model for sales forecasting and budget planning.

## Tools Used
- R
- ggplot2
